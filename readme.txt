This open source project provides a Python-based GUI application that uses the XGB-MLP hybrid machine learning model to predict the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete beams under fire and corrosion conditions. Note : Users need to prepare a trained XGBoost model and MLP model in advance. To implement the GUI, the file path in the code needs to be changed by itself.
